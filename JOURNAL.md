## July 4th, 2025
I am starting now! I saw the posting on the bambu website for the Mini Arcade contest and taht inspired me to make this control board for arcade games on PC
I have made a little sketch and defined my scope today. 

Features:
- Arcade Joystick
- 7 input buttons
- 2 mini start/menu buttons
- Bluetooth and wireless
- LEDs
- A 3d Printed encolsure

I will need to make a control board with solderable points since the panel will be pretty big and that helps save on cost. This will have a pi pico and a battery charging circuit, as well as all of the IO broken out so I can easily solder all of the button wires on.
I will also need the 3D printed enclosure and maybe a cooling fan just in case

## Time Spent: ~ .5 hours
